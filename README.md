# Senisafe

## Description
An Senior Citizen mHealth web app built based on providing efficient accesibility of health services and other medical necessities, in a way that takes into account specific UI accesibility issues
## Technologies Used
We primarily use react for our front-end requirements. We also have implemented local storage for storing details of medications, as due to time shortages we could not afford to create a backend storage
## API Refferences
We use HAPI FHIR api to request FHIR details. This API is used for testing purposes only and thus does not require any token or patient id to run. this API can easily be interchanged with any viable FHIR api's provided you have a valid patient ID

 # Future Scope
 Since we have created this in react, with slight adjustments and rewriting, as well as reconfiguration we could potentialy convert this into a react-native app
